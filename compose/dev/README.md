## Download the Archivematica sources

Go to the root folder of this repository and run `make clone`.

## Build the environment

First we need to build the services. This step may take a while because we're
building multiple Docker images with the Archivematica dependencies.

    $ docker-compose build

Start everything:

    $ docker-compose up -d

We need to bootstrap the system:

    $ make bootstrap

List the containers running:

    $ docker-compose ps

You should see something like the following:

```
$ docker-compose ps
               Name                              Command               State                            Ports

```

Nginx is the web frontend and you can use it to access Archivematica. The
`Ports` column shows which ports have been made available. Based on the example
above, open your browser and point to:

- http://127.0.0.1:32821 (Archivematica Dashboard)
- http://127.0.0.1:32820 (Archivematica Storage Service)

The ports assigned are not permament.

Once you're done you can destroy everything with: `make destroy`. This task
will also remove the data volumes, e.g. the changes written to disk (like those
belonging in a database) will also be lost permanently.

## Proceeding with the installer

Log in the Storage Service first using the default user: `test`, password
`test`. Go to the user page under the *Administration* area to find your API
key. Next, open the dashboard. You will need the API key when you're requested
to introduce the connection details of the Storage Service.

## Development workflow

If your working on webapps like `dashboard` or `archivematica-storage-service`
your changes in the source code should take effect immediately - you don't need
to restart the service. But in some cases you also need to regenerate the
container (e.g. if you change parameters in `docker-compose.dev.yml`). A nice
shortcut that can do that for you while making sure the service is started
again is:

    $ docker-compose up -d archivematica-dashboard

If you add the `--build` flag, the Docker image will be rebuilt too. This is
useful when you've made changes to the `Dockerfile` or perhaps added new
dependencies to `requirements/*.txt` that you want to be installed. For
example:

    $ docker-compose up --build -d archivematica-dashboard

In some cases you need to go further and discard any image layer cached
previously. You can only do this using `docker-compose build` directly:

    $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull archivematica-dashboard

Our containers send log events to `stderr` by default. You can watch the
output using `docker-compose logs`. Use the `-f` argument to follow the log
output.
